# Heart Attack Prediction

This repository contains a Python project for analyzing and predicting heart attacks based on various health metrics. The project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm, to build a predictive model.

## Project Overview:
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection and prediction of heart attacks can significantly improve patient outcomes and save lives. This project aims to leverage machine learning to analyze heart health data and predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on various health indicators.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction dataset on Kaggle. It contains several features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more, along with a target variable indicating the presence or absence of a heart attack.

## Project Structure:
heart_attack_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data loading, preprocessing, exploration, model training, and evaluation.
heart.csv: CSV file containing the heart health dataset.
README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project.

Open and run the heart_attack_prediction.ipynb notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment to execute the code and analyze the heart health dataset.

Libraries Used:
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn

## Results:
The project involves:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and their impact on heart attacks.
Building a Gaussian Naive Bayes classification model to predict heart attacks.
Evaluating the model's performance using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

Acknowledgments:
Kaggle for providing the heart attack dataset.
Scikit-learn for providing machine learning tools and algorithms.
